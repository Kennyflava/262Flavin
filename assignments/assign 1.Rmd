# WHy I'm taking this Course
## I want to take this course because I am still pretty uncomfortable with coding. I often have problems with saving all of the code and reading the code. I struggle with understanding it as well. I am not very comfortable with Github and would like to be comfortable. I would love to feel confident in my skills with R as well. 

# Data Science Background

## I do not have a lot of data science background. I have only taken the 206 course at Bren Hall. I have had few assignments in R. I didn't do the homework by myself, I often had someone else to help me. I'd like to try to be comfortable with doing it myself. 
# Initialize Git repository
